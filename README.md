# 🔢 Number to Words Converter using C++

## 📖 Description
This is a basic C++ program that converts numeric input into its word representation. If the input contains any non-digit characters, they are replaced with an exclamation mark (`!`).

## 🚀 How It Works
- Enter a number (e.g., `1234`).
- The program converts each digit into words (`One Two Three Four`).
- If the input contains invalid characters (e.g., `98a7`), they are replaced with `!`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++ (Standard Library)

## 📸 Example Output
Phone: 1234 One Two Three Four

Phone: 98a7 Nine Eight ! Seven
